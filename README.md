# World Weather App
Generates weather for a given location. This is the first independent project I made after learning React and completing a few follow-along projects. 

## Technologies
This project was created using:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React.js

# Features
Users are able to choose a country and then a city for the chosen country. Weather data is then shown for the chosen location. This includes:
- Current temperature, pressure, humidity, winds
- Current forecast
- Chance of rain
- Sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and moonset

# Installation
You will need to have Node >= version 10.16 and npm >= version 5.6.
- Download files to a folder of your choosing.
- Navigate to the folder in terminal using `cd`. 
- Install the dependencies and run the code by typing the following:

```
npm install && npm start
```
